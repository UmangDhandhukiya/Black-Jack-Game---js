# 🃏 Black‑Jack Game (JavaScript)

A responsive and interactive browser-based Black‑Jack (21) game built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. This project showcases my ability to build engaging user interfaces, apply game logic, and manage state effectively with vanilla JavaScript.

I aimed to build a clean and responsive game interface that reflects both creativity and problem-solving skills.
